# Web API:
## `/game/<gameid>/<playerid>`
### `GET`
Returns the current game state as viewed by playerid
PlayerID is NOT player name, it's a secret ID.
```
{
    'dice'        : [1,2,3,...],  // The player's dice
    'turn'        : 'Kevin',      // Whose turn it is
    'current_bet' : [1,5]         // Current bet, in this case one 5
    'prev_values' : [4,3,2,1,4,6] // In the previous round, how many of each dice there were
}
```
### `POST`
A player makes a turn by posting something of the following format:
```
{
    'bet'        : [4,5] // Number and value of bet. In this case 4 5's
    'bluff_call' : False // True if the player is calling a bluff and False if they want to make the above bet.
                         // Bet is ignored if bluff_call is True
}
```
This will return OK if the move is accepted, or the following error code if not:
 - ???? - Bet Invalid
 - ???? - Not allowed to call blufff, e.g. on first turn.
