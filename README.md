```
{
    'hand_number' : 5              // Current hand number
    'dice'        : [0,0,2,1,0,1], // How many of each dice value the player has. In this case, 2 3's, a 4, and a 6.
    'turn'        : 'Kevin',       // Whose turn it is
    'current_bet' : [1,5],         // Current bet, in this case one 5
    'prev_loser'  : "Kevin",       // In the previous round, which player lost a die
    'prev_values' : [4,3,2,1,4,6]  // In the previous round, how many of each dice value there were
}
```
### `POST`
A player makes a turn by posting something of the following format:
```
{
    'bet'        : [4,5], // Number and value of bet. In this case 4 5's
    'bluff_call' : False, // True if the player is calling a bluff and False if they want to make the above bet.
                          // Bet is ignored if bluff_call is True
}
```
This will return OK if the move is accepted, or the following error code if not:
 - ???? - Not your turn
 - ???? - Bet Invalid
 - ???? - Not allowed to call blufff, e.g. on first turn.
